            <h2>üéÆ Building My Game Design Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently refining my game design portfolio. This includes documenting past projects,
                writing devlogs, and creating a clean landing page on GitHub Pages. I'm focusing on clarity,
                showcasing not just what I made, but how I think.

            <h2>üíº Career Transition & Growth</h2>
            <p>
                I recently left my previous job and am exploring freelance and full-time opportunities related
                to game design, UX, or creative direction. I'm also researching how to better present my past
                experiences across design, writing, and multimedia.

            <h2>üìö Learning & Deep Focus</h2>
            <p>
                I'm reducing dopamine-heavy habits (like endless YouTube) to rebuild focus. I'm practicing
                mindfulness, reading, and limiting distractions. I'm also revisiting fundamentals like writing,
                grammar, and articulation to improve how I communicate my work.

            <h2>üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Health & Personal Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm working on gaining weight and building a better relationship with my body through consistent
                gym training, proper nutrition, and recovery. I also want to create space for more socializing,
                rest, and meaningful reflection.
