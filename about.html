            <h1>Who is JC?</h1>
            <p>I'm a game designer with a passion for crafting player-centric experiences. I enjoy working on mechanics,
                level design,
                and systems that support both fun and function. Currently based in [Your Location], I also dabble in
                audio, UI/UX, and
                writing.</p>

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe great games respect the player’s time, curiosity, and emotions. I design with clarity, player
                feedback
                loops, and progression pacing in mind — aiming for experiences that are both satisfying and meaningful.

            <p>
                I enjoy K-dramas, manga, and catching up on games I missed growing up. When I’m not designing, I’m
                probably
                exploring game design theory, lifting at home, or working on delayed gratification habits to be more
                focused.

            <h2>From Multimedia Arts to Game Design</h2>
            <p>
                My foundation in AB Multimedia Arts taught me to think visually and tell stories through design. Over
                time, I
                gravitated toward interactive storytelling and player experience, eventually diving deep into game
                design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with UI and audio consulting, I slowly transitioned into designing levels, mechanics, and
                complete game
                flows. Today, I bring that interdisciplinary mindset to every project—balancing creativity, structure,
                and
                player-centric thinking.
